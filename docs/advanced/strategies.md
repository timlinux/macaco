# Practice Strategies

Optimize your practice for maximum improvement.

## Structured Practice

### Daily Routine

1. **Warm-up** (5 min): One Beginner round
2. **Focused Practice** (15 min): Rounds targeting weak areas
3. **Challenge** (10 min): One round above your comfort level

### Weekly Goals

- Complete at least 5 rounds
- Improve one category average by 5%
- Try one new round difficulty

## Category-Specific Training

### Weak Category Focus

Check your statistics to identify weak categories, then:

1. Review the vim basics docs for that category
2. Do 3 rounds focusing on that type
3. Use hints liberally to learn optimal solutions
4. Repeat until average efficiency reaches 80%+

### Motion Mastery

If motion is weak:

1. Practice `w`, `b`, `e` until automatic
2. Add `f` and `t` motions
3. Incorporate counts (`3w`, `2b`)
4. Master `$` and `0`

### Delete Proficiency

If delete is weak:

1. Master `x` and `dd`
2. Learn `dw` and `D`
3. Add text objects (`daw`, `diw`)
4. Practice `dt` and `df`

### Change Excellence

If change is weak:

1. Understand `c` = `d` + `i`
2. Practice `cw` and `cc`
3. Master `ci{object}` patterns
4. Use `C` for line changes

## Mental Models

### Think in Objects

Instead of thinking about characters, think about:

- Words
- Lines
- Text inside quotes/brackets
- Text until a character

### Operator + Motion

Build commands as:

```
What do I want to do? (d, c, y)
To what? (w, iw, $, f{char})
```

### Preview the Result

Before executing:

1. Visualize the end state
2. Plan the shortest path
3. Execute

## Plateau Breaking

If progress stalls:

1. **Review basics**: Often fundamentals need reinforcing
2. **Try new approaches**: Different commands can achieve the same result
3. **Watch solutions**: Use hints to see optimal approaches
4. **Take breaks**: Muscle memory forms during rest

## Tracking Progress

### Metrics to Watch

- **Efficiency trend**: Should increase over time
- **Category balance**: All categories should improve
- **Time consistency**: Low variance indicates mastery

### Milestones

- First A grade
- First S grade
- 100% efficiency on any task
- All categories above 80%
- Complete Expert round

## Competition Preparation

For competitive play (future feature):

1. Achieve consistent S grades on all round types
2. Minimize time variance
3. Practice under time pressure
4. Master recovery from mistakes
